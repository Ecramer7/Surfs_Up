## Summary 
Oahu would be a fantastic location to launch an ice cream shop based on varying temperatures by month. The reason is because the temperatures to not have a significant change from the hot months like June, to the colder months like December. The Mean, Min, and Max temperatures in June are 75, 64, and 85 degrees, respectively. In December the Mean, Min and Max temperatures are 71, 56, and 83 degrees. These temperature variations are not significant enough to prevent people from wanting a cold treat to combat the heat. Additional queries that could be performed to improve this analysis are ones including marketing data such as competition and popular surf locations.
